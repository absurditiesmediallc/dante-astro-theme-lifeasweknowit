**Project Overview:**
To build a website where users are able to access the photos and recordings of the earlier musical works of Jonny and the Viscounts, and Richard Pfahl, performing as a one man band under the name "Rich E Fall and the Music Machine".

## Objectives

1. To convert analog form audio files currenntly stored on acetate, reel to reel and other mediums into digital media for archival purposes as well as to allow the listening public to easily access and hear said files. 
2. To direct listeners to new music produced and made available on mixcloud and soundcloud.
3. To build a list of interested users email addresses in order to send out updates as needed.
4. To find recordings and collect them in a single repository where they can be accessed by family, friends, and all those who have enjoyed, been inspired by, or connected over his work through the many years he's been creating them

## Features

1. **Photos Collection:**

- Users are able to browse a gallery of digitized pictures featuring Rich E Fall as well as his previous band, Jonny and the Vicounts. These photos had previously not been digitally archived, so now they are saved for the future and will not be at risk of becoming lost or degraded by time. 
-Captions may be provided to the images to explain who is featured in the image and the location where they were performing. 


2. **News Updates:**

- Users can read articles about up and coming music being made now, future plans, and any potential locations they may be able to see a performance. 
- Interested users would be able to add their email address to sign up for newsletters so that any marketing done in the future would be more effective, starting with an already built list of potentially interested site visitors. 


3. **Community Hub:**

- A collection of social media accounts will allow to users to connect with Richard and eachother to create music together. Links to come soon.
